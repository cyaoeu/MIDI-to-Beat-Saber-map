# MIDIbeat (v0.09 (pre-alpha))
Use the DAW Reaper to make MIDI files, then convert those files to Beat Saber map data (JSON).

Read the code for now, very WIP...

Input: .mid file (hardcoded as beatsaber.mid for now)

Output: .json file (hardcoded as Expert.json for now)

Change the path and outputpath variables in settings.py to the location of your .mid file.

TODO:
- Work on UX DAW side (shareable template with custom keys/theme and so on) (50%)
- Create a beatmap using the tool to fix various issues.
- Add GUI that calls map generation script and remove hard coded paths.
- Clean up code.
