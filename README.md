# MIDI-to-Beat-Saber-map
Convert MIDI tracks to Beat Saber map data (JSON).

Read the code for now, very WIP...

Input: .mid file (hardcoded as beatsaber.mid for now)

Output: .json file (hardcoded as data.json for now)

Change the path variable in settings.py to the location of your .mid file.

TODO:
- Favorite mode, specified notes for certain note type/line/layer/cut direction combinations (with optional cut direction override using MIDI channel).
- Add GUI that calls map generation script and remove hard coded paths.
